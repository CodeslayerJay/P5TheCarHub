# P5TheCarHub

Auto Sales And Inventory Management App | Live Demo: [P5TheCarHub.AzureWebsites.net](https://P5TheCarHub.AzureWebsites.net)

## Additional Information

The app is built utilizing "clean architecture" design patterns and 95% decoupling from most frameworks that are commonly used
(i.e. Entity Framework, Identity). Although the final implementation uses a few choice frameworking tools, the "core" project/layer is left interchangeable with other ORMs, Identity Providers, Validation, etc. You can change these in the "Infrastructure" and "UI" layers
respectivily.
